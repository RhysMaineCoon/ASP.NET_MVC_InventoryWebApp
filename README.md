# ASP.NET_MVC_InventoryWebApp
This is my final project for my ASP.NET class. My project is an inventory app that allows the user to add, edit, or delete items and add each item to a category.

Completed features:
    • User can create, edit, or delete categories (name) for their items. 
    • User can create, edit, or delete items (name, description, quantity, category).
    • On both tables, the user can sort by column, page through the table content, and filter/search through the tables.
    • Both category and item views have a dynamic search using a short JavaScript script.
    • I made the navigation a little more guided and smooth.
    • I kept the design simple. I wanted the user’s attention focused on the tables. 

Features that are still a work in progress:
    • I’m having issues with adding a category description when the application is running. I added and migrated the description after I created the model, view, and controller. 
    • I created a user account model, controller, and view, but there are validation issues that prevent users from creating an account.
    • The contact form is not connected to anything in the back end.
    • Some design elements could use some polishing.
